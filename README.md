- Created the **`App.jsx`** component with a simple heading: `Welcome to React Shrabani`.
- Understood how **Babel converts JSX** into `React.createElement()`.
- Added **child component**: `NetflisSeries`.
- Updated `App.jsx` to include **movie card** with:
  - Image
  - Name
  - Rating
  - Summary
- Learned about **React fragments (`<>...</>`)** to wrap multiple elements.

- Committed & pushed code to GitHub to track progress.
# React Learning - Day 2

## Overview
Today I continued learning React and worked on **dynamic rendering, conditional rendering, and reusable components**. This was part of my personal study project.

## Components Created
1. **NetflixSeries**
   - Displays series details like name, rating, summary, and genre.
   - Uses **functions inside JSX** for conditional rendering.
   - Button shows "Watch Now" or "Not Available" based on age.

2. **Header**
   - Simple reusable header component.

3. **Footer**
   - Simple reusable footer component.

4. **Practices**
   - Demonstrates **conditional rendering** with arrays.
   - Shows "No student Found" if the students array is empty.

## Key Learnings
- Using **variables** and **functions inside JSX**.
- Conditional rendering using `&&` and ternary operators.
- Default export vs named export and **how to combine them**.
- Importing multiple components in `App.jsx`.
- Rendering multiple components dynamically.

## Next Steps
- Make NetflixSeries dynamic using props.
- Practice mapping arrays to render multiple series.
- Learn useState for interactive components.
